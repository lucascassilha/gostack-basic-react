:rocket: The Challenge
------------------
This challenge was proposed at a [**Rocketseat**](https://rocketseat.com.br/) GoSack bootcamp! The main objective was improving at ReactJS basic concepts.This project was made **from scratch**, without the use of *create-react-app*

The challenge GitHub page can be seen [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafio-04/blob/master/README.md#desafio-04-introdu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-ao-react)
(Brazilian Portuguese)

- Implemented a few CSS changes, including the *react-icons* library
- Used a **function/hooks** based application instead of a class/state!
